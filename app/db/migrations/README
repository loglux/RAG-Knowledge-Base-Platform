Generic single-database configuration with async support.

## Usage

### Create a new migration (auto-generate from models)
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description of changes"
```

### Apply all pending migrations
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback last migration
```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

### Show current version
```bash
alembic current
```

### Show migration history
```bash
alembic history --verbose
```

### Create empty migration (manual)
```bash
alembic revision -m "Description"
```

### Upgrade to specific revision
```bash
alembic upgrade <revision_id>
```

### Downgrade to specific revision
```bash
alembic downgrade <revision_id>
```

## Important Notes

- This configuration uses async SQLAlchemy with asyncpg
- Database URL is loaded from app/config.py settings
- Migrations are stored in app/db/migrations/versions/
- Always review auto-generated migrations before applying
- Test migrations on development database first
